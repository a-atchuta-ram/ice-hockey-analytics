## Abstract
* The first objective of this study is to develop a win probability prediction model for ice hockey games. By analyzing various game factors, such as team statistics, player performance, and situational variables, a predictive model will be constructed to estimate the likelihood of a team winning at any given moment during a game.
** Application: This information can be invaluable for coaches, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding line changes, strategies, and game management.

* The second objective of this study is to utilize heatmaps and shot analysis to understand a player's shooting tendencies and locations on the ice. By analyzing historical shot data, the study aims to identify patterns and preferences in a player's shooting behavior.
** Application: This information can then be used to assist goalies in understanding where a particular player is likely to shoot from, enabling them to position themselves more effectively and increase their chances of making a save.
